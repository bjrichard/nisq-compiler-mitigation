# Qubit Review Prompt

Review this Qubit class for correctness, clarity, and future extensibility within a compilation and mitigation pipeline.

Specifically evaluate:
- Whether immutability is properly enforced
- Whether invariants are clearly defined and validated
- Whether equality semantics are appropriate
- Whether this abstraction will support compilation passes and qubit remapping later

Do not rewrite the implementation.
Provide critique only.
